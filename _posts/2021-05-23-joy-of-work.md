Corporations are the big phenomena of the 20th century. They understand how to leverage specialized knowledge and provide something valuable to the market place.
But working in a corporation gives us a lot of abstraction on how our job provides value.

Not knowing or being unable to track the value we provide to the rest of humanity can have bad effects on us. We will loose interest in our work, in the tasks that we
deliver everyday. Coupled with a mediocre manager, we are destined to face a mid-life crisis.

Having a side hustle is not the solution. You may have a side hustle that doesn't provide you enough money AND it's not in the field that you like. For example, I don't like
to sell Tshirts on Amazon Merch, I don't know anything about it and I don't have any interest in it. I think we should start doing a work that we find meaningful, a side project
that not necessary gives us money; but, sure gives us joy and learning about the marketplace. I hope after a few learnings and launches, we learn enough to make some $ to keep
those projects afloat.

I don't see a point in leaving corporate world, it pays well and you have great opportunity to have a good impact on the humanity, specially if you stay long enough to be
promoted to more executive positions. So I would say keep it and work on a project that teaches us how to plan, launch and deliver value.
