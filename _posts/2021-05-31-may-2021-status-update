## Projects
##### Income: $0
##### Investments: $250 (Youtube channel, for gears) + $30 (borj.io, for domain and email) + $10 (releasechannel.com, for domain)
- **Youtube channel: Daily SRE & DevOps (started 12 Jan 2021) **>> Currently has 386 Subscribers, and 360 public watch hours. My strategy is to continue posting 1 video per week. And will start promoting it more actively. (If you ask how, I still don't know. You will definitely see what I have tried). 
- **Borj.io (started 1 Mar 2021)**: Searching the net for doc leak for companies. Discountinued. I don't like org sales.
- **Releasechannel.com (started 15 May 2021)**: UI is out, subscribe funtionality is there with 20 CNCF graduated projects. So let's start promoting it and see if we can get traction. I will implement sending updates after I get around 100 subscribers.

## Next Month Strategy
Well, projects can't attract users by themselves. I will spend 1 hour/day on promoting the projects, and the rest of hours on a new project. ðŸ¤ž

## Final notes
Putting this much of hours after work is not only exhausting but also crazy. I'm definitely enjoying this, it's a good aspect to my life.

P.S. Learning vue.js on developing the projects :D Frontend is whole another league.
